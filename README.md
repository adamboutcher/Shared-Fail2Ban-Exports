# Shared Fail2Ban Exports

This repo is an export of the [Shared Fail2Ban](https://github.com/Clarky-Bear/Shared-Fail2Ban "Shared Fail2Ban") ban lists (datasets) from the UKI-SCOTGRID-DURHAM and [IPPP](http://ippp.dur.ac.uk "IPPP") 

## Exported Datasets

The data has been exported showing the IP Address that was banned and the number of bans (count) in a csv. The data spans from mid-2020 to march 2025.

- f2b_shared_counts - The whole dump
- f2b_shared_2020 - Only IPs from 2020
- f2b_shared_2021 - Only IPs from 2021
- f2b_shared_2022 - Only IPs from 2022
- f2b_shared_2023 - Only IPs from 2023
- f2b_shared_2024 - Only IPs from 2024
- f2b_shared_2025 - Only IPs from 2025

The data is only a list of addresses and the number of times our fail2ban has blocked them to be used for reseatch or analysis. We highly recommend you double check and sanitise any data prior to use.
